# NSAProject

## This project is being hosted on https://troyanosalpha.000webhostapp.com/

### Summary

We developed a web based mission visualizer for GMAT missions accompanied with a parser to interface both parts, we solved the challenge by transforming the simulation from GMAT into a easy to understand format, including the mission concept, a timeline and the objective of the playload.

### Project Details

We researched the details of a couple of missions and based on those details we configured a mission in GMAT to generate a Report File witch gives the x, y, z coordinates of the ship in the simulation, we then put that file through a python algorithm that we desinged to convert it to a JSON file that we feed to our web visualizer.

This visualizer works with any mission and can be easily scaled to have houndreds of missions, we could integrate a database to manage these resources and make them avaliable in the home page of our demo.

We hope to make all NASA mission launches easily avaliable to anybody that wants to know the function of the payload, how it was launched and where to, and the trajectory that it followed.

We all used VSCode to program all the different parts, Git to share and work together on the code, GitHub as our project repository, a combination of HTML, CSS and JS to build the web page and an integration of X3D to build the visualizer and python to parse the GMAT output.

### This project was developed by Troyanos α over 24hrs on the Nasa Space Apps Hackathon's local event at Santiago de Querétaro, Mexico
